//The following are strings which will be compared against the user input when deciding what command to execute.
//I've read that macros are more effective as basic constants than variable definitions. Feel free to correct me.
#define run_str "run"
#define list_str "list"
#define fcfs_str "fcfs"

//The maximum number of characters to compare against each possible command string
//is 10. This number is arbitrary, but must be larger than the longest possible command string, otherwise
//input like 'runaad' will call run() and priorityasda would run priority().
